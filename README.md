# MeeshQuest

This is a project from my data structure class.
The idea of the MeeshQuest project is to emulate some of the functionality of map sites like MapQuest or Google Maps. We will get cities from database of cities and insert them into a spatial data structure that can be used to draw a picture. The basic spatial data structure used is a quadtree - a sort of 2-dimensional binary search tree.
